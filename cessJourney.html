				<h2>My Journey in College</h2>

					<h3>âœ¨ Freshman Year: Stepping Into the Unknown</h3>
					<p>
						Freshman year was a rollercoaster. We started with online classes,
						where I only saw my classmates through little boxes on a screen.
						Transitioning to face-to-face classes was both exciting and
						nerve-wracking. It was the first time I got to meet everyone in
						person, and at first, we were all a bit awkward and unsure â€”
						sometimes even getting into little troubles as we tried to figure
						things out. I remember feeling nervous just to approach people or
						start a conversation. But as the days passed, and as we worked on
						projects and shared more laughs, the walls between us slowly came
						down. Talking to them became easier, and soon enough, those
						once-strangers became friends I could rely on. Looking back, I
						realize how much we grew just by stepping into that new, unfamiliar
						world together.

					<h3>ðŸ“š Sophomore Year: Trials, Teachers, and Triumphs</h3>
					<p>
						Sophomore year hit like a storm, especially during the first
						semester. It felt like one challenge after another, with
						back-to-back terror teachers who pushed us to our limits. There were
						moments when I truly questioned whether we could handle it â€” the
						pressure, the workload, the long nights. But somehow, we powered
						through. And along the way, something beautiful happened: I met new
						friends, people who made the tough times feel lighter and the
						victories sweeter. The people around me were filled with love,
						support, and the same determination to keep moving forward. Even in
						the hardest moments, I was reminded that we were not alone â€” we had
						each other.

					<h3>ðŸ’» Junior Year: A Turning Point</h3>
					<p>
						By junior year, things started to feel a little more manageable. We
						were no longer the same nervous students from before; we had learned
						the ropes, and some tasks even became second nature. But this year
						also marked the end of the carefree, happy atmosphere we enjoyed
						during sophomore year. The workload intensified, and the serious
						side of college life made itself known. Suddenly, time to rest
						became a luxury we couldnâ€™t afford. There were deadlines stacked on
						top of deadlines, and the stress sometimes felt overwhelming. But
						through it all, we kept going. Junior year taught me the importance
						of resilience and balance, of knowing when to push forward and when
						to take a breath, even if just for a moment.
